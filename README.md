# Generating parameterized waveguide holder designs in OpenSCAD
This repository contains the code used to generate parameterized waveguide holders with [OpenSCAD](https://github.com/openscad/openscad). The waveguide holders were then exported as a .stl file-extension and sliced using [Cura](https://github.com/Ultimaker/Cura) for 3D printing.
